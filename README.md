# SmartStreet

SmartStreet is an android application which is capable of interacting with smart objects. These smart objects are the Raspberry Pi micro-controllers which can detect the human interaction. These can take the human instructions from the SmartStreet app. Instructions can be like, play a song or light in different colors. So, user can select the song or lighting color from the app and the micro-controller receives those and acts accroding to that.
